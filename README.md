# Chunk weaver
Chunkweaver adds 7 MMO-like classes to the game;

- Engineer
- Wizard
- Explorer
- Miner
- Farmer
- Blacksmith
- Fighter

These classes contain buffs, while the base game is made harder. This will lead to players having to stick to their roles, and working together in order to survive.

Additionally, chunkweaver includes;

- Custom skill trees for each class
- 3 Fighter subclasses, each with their own ability
- A rift, to trade with entities from another plane, allowing for player-minted currencies
- Some Quality of Life stuff to handle such coins.
- A 'key' system allowing for more advanced item filtering and processing.
- A custom structure, where players can find tablets of knowledge, which grant skill points when consumed

And much more content, based around the idea of a more anarchy-oriented MMORPG experience. All in Modded SMP Minecraft!
